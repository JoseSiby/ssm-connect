## [1.1.0]

### Added
- SSH credential persistence: SSH key path and username are now auto-saved to `~/.ssm-connect/config.json` for convenient reuse
- Configuration prompt: one can opt-in to save SSH settings on first use
- `--reset-config` command-line flag to clear saved SSH credentials
- Support for reusing saved credentials with single-keystroke acceptance
- Automatic validation of saved SSH key paths before reuse

### Changed
- Refactored into modular structure.
- Introduced clearer prompts for SSH credential management

### Fixed
- Socket binding now explicitly uses localhost (127.0.0.1) instead of all network interfaces (addresses CodeQL security warning)

### Security
- Only SSH key paths and usernames stored in config (never the actual keys)

## [1.0.5]

### Fixed
- Security: Bind port discovery socket to localhost only (fixes CodeQL alert)

## [1.0.4]

### Added
- RDS port forwarding support via SSM using EC2 bastion hosts
- Two-step workflow for RDS connections (bastion selection â†’ RDS selection)
- Automatic local port selection for RDS forwarding

### Fixed
- Better error handling for RDS connection failures
- Validation for bastion instance connectivity

## [1.0.0]
